# bulls_cows_errors

A Cmake project with lots of errors, supposed to display bulls and cows after solving them.

The program is supposed to compute two values from two numbers of 6 digits:
    - bulls: common digits at the same place
    - cows: common digits but not at the same place

The project has many errors that prevent compiling, running or even giving the correct result. Use error messages and the debugger to identify them and get the correct results.
